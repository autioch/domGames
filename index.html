    <h1>Legacy code</h1>
    <p>This is an old (2010-2011) code. It has some nice ideas that I might tackle with someday, but overall requires a
        lot of refactoring, or even complete rewrite.</p>

    <p>The goal of the library was to provide simple components for creating simple, DOM based HTML games.</p>

    <p>However, with the emergence of the Canvas and Backbone I decided that this library could just extend Backbone and
        use canvas instead of DOM, so I stopped development.</p>

    <p>I decided to split the code using requirejs and updated dependencies, so one day I might actually return to the
        code.</p>
