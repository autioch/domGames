# Legacy code
This is an old (2010-2011) code. It has some nice ideas that I might tackle with someday, but overall requires a lot of refactoring, or even complete rewrite.

The goal of the library was to provide simple components for creating simple, DOM based HTML games.

However, with the emergence of the Canvas and Backbone I decided that this library could just extend Backbone and use canvas instead of DOM, so I stopped development.

I decided to split the code using https://requirejs.org/ and updated dependencies, so one day I might actually return to the code.
